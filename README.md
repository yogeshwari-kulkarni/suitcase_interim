# Suitcase Interim

Suitcase Interim is a mobile-first Drupal 7 theme. It is an implementation of the [IASTATE theme] that provides the Iowa State University look and feel.

It has been optimized for use with [Luggage_ISU] (recommended) but will also work with stock Drupal 7.

## Requirements

This theme requires the [Omega base theme (7.x-3.x-dev)].

## Installation with Luggage_ISU 5.x

If you are using [Luggage_ISU] 5.x then Suitcase Interim and Omega have been automatically included.

## Upgrading from Suitcase Classic

If you are upgrading from [Suitcase Classic] (included in [Luggage_ISU] prior to 5.x), see the [Upgrade page] of the wiki.

## Installation with Stock Drupal 7 or older versions of Luggage_ISU

Please follow the directions on the [Installation page] of the wiki.
